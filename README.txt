This Analysis was focused on data from 2008(spanning four months) on Air Transportation Delays From US Federal Aviation Administration.
THIS ANALYSIS WAS DONE 100% IN PYTHON.
DATA WRANGLING STEP:
1. the data was downloaded at: https://community.amstat.org/jointscsg-section/dataexpo/dataexpo2009
2. downloaded 2008 version of the data
3. imported into jupyter notebook.

DATA CLEANING STEPS:
4. No much cleaning was done as the dataset only has missing values with no tidyness and structural issues but with every other aspect of it being the way suitable for analysis.
5. I generated the 'Status' column/variable from the 'ArrDelay', 'Cancelled','diverted' Variables/columns with the following encoding ['ArrDelay'] <= 15 == 'on time', 
['ArrDelay'] >= 15] = 'slightly delayed', ['ArrDelay'] >= 60] = 'highly delayed', ['Diverted'] == 1] = 'diverted', ['Cancelled'] == 1] = 'cancelled'
6. in CancellationCode Column, i did data encoding of A: carrier, B:weather, C:NAS, D:security.

Key Airline Carrier Abbreviations:
'WN: Southwest Airlines', 'AA: American Airlines', 'MQ: American Eagle Airlines',
'UA: United Airlines', 'OO: Skywest Airlines', 'DL: Delta Airlines', 'XE: ExpressJet',
'CO: Continental Airlines', 'US: US Airways', 'EV: Atlantic Southeast Airlines', 'NW: Northwest Airlines', 
'FL: AirTran Airways', 'YV: Mesa Airlines', 'B6: JetBlue Airways', 'OH: Comair', '9E: Pinnacle Airlines', 
'AS: Alaska Airlines', 'F9: Frontier Airlines', 'HA: Hawaiian Airlines', 'AQ: Aloha Airlines'

KEY EXPLORATION STEPS: 
UNIVARIATE VISUALISATION >> BIVARIATE VISUALISATION >> MULTIVARIATE VISUALISATION

VISUALISATION SUMMARY:
I wanted to know through visualisation how many percent of air flights was delayed and how many was on-time.
Again, i wanted to investigate through visualisatio the major reasons for flight cancellation and as well as investigate the month cancellation occured the most.
I studied with a scatterplot the Arrival delay against Scheduled departure so i will understand unexpected correlation. i picked up the delay propagation and 
investigated which airline manages it well. i studied the correlation of
various delay types such as NASdelay,SecurityDelay,WeatherDealy, LateAircraftDelay, and CarrierDelay and found an interesting correlations.
i went on to investigate the airlines that manages departure delays better.


KEY INSIGHTS FROM UNIVARIATE EXPLORATION:
1. whooping 72.6% of all flights was ON-TIME, followed by 17.2% of slightly delayed flights.
2. Carrier and Weather has close call at 40.5% and 39.9% respectively flight cancellation 
reasons, followed by NAS in the third place. surprisenly no flight cancellation due to Security reasons.
3. Councellation of flight peaked in February and march.


KEY INSIGHTS FROM BIVARIATE EXPLORATION:
4. Regarding the time of the day the take off was scheduled, it can be seen in the higher part of the scatterplot how the delays are concentrated in an hourly manner, focused on the hour.
As the day goes on, there are more and more delays, but as it's shown in the center of the scatterplot, the delayed flights get divided into two groups: one with longer delays and other 
with shorter. One likely interpretation is that the delays generated by previous flights either increase or decrease in each following trip.

5. CH, 'EV: Atlantic Southeast Airlines', 'F9: Frontier Airlines' and 'NW: Northwest Airlines', are the top companies with the least Delay propagation

KEY INSIGHTS FROM MULTIVARIATE EXPLORATION:
6. the similar trend amongst NASdelay,SecurityDelay,WeatherDealy, LateAircraftDelay, and CarrierDelay proves there is a strong correlation among them.
7. 'WN: Southwest Airlines' and 'OO: Skywest Airlines' is a better Airline company in terms of managing Departure delay while 'HA: Hawaiian Airlines' 
and 'AQ: Aloha Airlines' are the worst.
